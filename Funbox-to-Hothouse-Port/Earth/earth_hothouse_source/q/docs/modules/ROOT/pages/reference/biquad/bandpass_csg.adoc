= Band Pass Filter; Constant Skirt Gain

include::../../common.adoc[]

== Overview

Band pass second-order IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filter with constant skirt gain, peak gain = Q. This filter is embodied by the `bandpass_csg` class.

== Include

```c++
#include <q/fx/biquad.hpp>
```

== Declaration

```c++
struct bw <1>
{
   double val; // in octaves
};

struct bandpass_csg : biquad
{
         bandpass_csg(frequency f, float sps, bw _bw);
         bandpass_csg(frequency f, float sps, double q = 0.707);

   void  config(frequency f, float sps, bw _bw);
   void  config(frequency f, float sps, double q = 0.707);
};
```

<1> Utility type to distinguish bandwidth from q which is just a double

== Expressions

In addition to valid expressions for {biquad}, `bandpass_csg` allows these expressions.

=== Notation

`bf`              :: Object of type `bandpass_csg`.
`f`               :: Object of type `frequency`.
`sps`             :: Floating point value representing samples per second.
`b`               :: Bandwidth (in octaves).
`q`               :: Q or quality factor.
`a [, b, c, d]`   :: Required `a`, optional `b, c, d`.

=== Constructor

| Expression                     | Semantics

| `bandpass_csg(f, sps [, q])`   |  Construct a `bandpass_csg` filter from `f`, `sps` and optional `q` (defaults to `0.707`).
| `bandpass_csg(f, sps, bw\{b})` |  Construct a `bandpass_csg` filter from `f`, `sps` and `b` (bandwidth).

NOTE: C++ brace initialization may also be used.
