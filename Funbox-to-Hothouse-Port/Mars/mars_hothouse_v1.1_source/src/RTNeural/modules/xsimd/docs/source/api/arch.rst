Architecture manipulation
=========================

xsimd provides an high level description of the instruction sets it manipulates.
The mentionned types are primarily used as template parameters for :ref:`batch
<xsimd-batch-ref>`, and when interacting with :cpp:func:`xsimd::dispatch()`.

The best available architecture is available at compile time through
``xsimd::best_arch`` which also happens to be ``xsimd::default_arch``.
