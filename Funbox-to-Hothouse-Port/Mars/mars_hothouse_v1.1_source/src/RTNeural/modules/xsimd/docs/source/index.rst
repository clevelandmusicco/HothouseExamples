C++ wrappers for SIMD intrinsics.

Introduction
------------

SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is a feature of microprocessors that has been available for many years. SIMD instructions perform a single operation
on a batch of values at once, and thus provide a way to significantly accelerate code execution. However, these instructions differ between microprocessor
vendors and compilers.

`xsimd` provides a unified means for using these features for library authors. Namely, it enables manipulation of batches of numbers with the same arithmetic
operators as for single values. It also provides accelerated implementation of common mathematical functions operating on batches.

`xsimd` makes it easy to write a single algorithm, generate one version of the algorithm per micro-architecture and pick the best one at runtime, based on the
running processor capability.

You can find out more about this implementation of C++ wrappers for SIMD intrinsics at the `The C++ Scientist`_. The mathematical functions are a
lightweight implementation of the algorithms also used in `boost.SIMD`_.

`xsimd` requires a C++11 compliant compiler. The following C++ compilers are supported:

+-------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Compiler                | Version                       |
+=========================+===============================+
| Microsoft Visual Studio | MSVC 2015 update 2 and above  |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------+
| g++                     | 4.9 and above                 |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------+
| clang                   | 3.7 and above                 |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------+

The following SIMD instruction set extensions are supported:

+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Architecture | Instruction set extensions                              |
+==============+=========================================================+
| x86          | SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, FMA3, AVX2 |
+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| x86          | AVX512 (gcc7 and higher)                                |
+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| x86 AMD      | same as above + FMA4                                    |
+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| ARM          | ARMv7, ARMv8                                            |
