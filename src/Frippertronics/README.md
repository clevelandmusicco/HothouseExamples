# Frippertronics

## Description

A basic simulation of a "Frippertronics"-like effect, also loosely inspired by the Soma Cosmos. It features two long-ish, modulated tape-like delay lines with controls to alter the feedback of each individual delay and the amount of cross feedback between the dealys.

The foot switches are used in a momentary fashion, input into the delay lines only happens while you are holding down the first foot switch whereas the second foot switch is used to erase the currently heard sounds from entering the delay lines again. 

The times of the individual delay lines are prime-number based like the Cosmos so that the repeats intersect with different overlaps. You can pick one of the 4 delay time sets with the position of Knob 2:

- 2.5 and 1.721 seconds
- 5 and 3 seconds
- 17 and 11 seconds
- 23 and 17 seconds
